Problem Statement: Notepad Application in Angular
Project Overview
Develop a Notepad application using Angular that allows users to create, edit, save, and manage text notes. 
The application should provide a simple and intuitive interface for text editing with basic formatting options.

Functional Requirements
User Interface:

Create a clean and responsive user interface using Angular Material or a similar UI library.
Provide a text area for writing and editing notes.
Implement a list view to display all saved notes with titles and timestamps.
Allow users to select and view a specific note from the list.
Note Management:

Enable users to create a new note with a title and body.
Allow users to edit the content of existing notes.
Provide functionality to save notes to local storage or a backend server.
Implement a delete functionality to remove notes.
Text Formatting:

Add basic text formatting options such as bold, italic, underline, and bullet points.
Allow users to apply formatting to selected text within the note.
Search and Filter:

Implement a search feature to allow users to find notes by title or content.
Provide filtering options to view notes based on creation date or modification date.
Auto-Save and Version Control:

Implement an auto-save feature to periodically save the note content.
Allow users to view and revert to previous versions of a note.
User Authentication:

Implement user authentication to enable multiple users to create and manage their own notes.
Allow users to register, log in, and log out.
Technical Requirements
Angular Framework:

Use Angular 14+ for developing the application.
Structure the project using Angular CLI and follow best practices for Angular development.
State Management:

Use Angular services to manage the state of notes and user sessions.
Consider using NgRx for more complex state management needs.
Routing:

Implement Angular Router to navigate between different views (e.g., note list, note editor, user authentication).
Storage:

Use local storage or IndexedDB for client-side storage of notes.
Optionally, implement a backend server using Node.js/Express and a database like MongoDB for persistent storage.
Testing:

Write unit tests for critical components and services using Jasmine and Karma.
Implement end-to-end tests using Protractor or Cypress.
Deployment:

Prepare the application for deployment using Angular CLI build tools.
Deploy the application to a web server or cloud platform like Firebase, AWS, or Heroku.
Deliverables
Code Repository:

Provide a GitHub repository with the complete source code of the application.
Include a README file with instructions on how to set up, run, and build the application.
Documentation:

Document the project architecture, key components, and services.
Provide user documentation on how to use the Notepad application.
Demo:

Deploy the application to a live server and provide a link to the running application.
